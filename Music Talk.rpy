            m 7wud "The imagery of judgement and the idea of a 'dusty old line' in the sand also evoke a sense of a traditional or established way of seeing things."
            m 7wub "Meanwhile, the notion of a flight or fight response illustrates the struggle between staying true to one's morals and values or giving in to temptation and greed."
            m 4wub "Considering that the context of the song is a Siracusan mafia story, I can think of a ton of possible stories unfolding!"
            m 3eub "There's also the promise made by the singer, and how she refuses to choose between flight or fight."
            m 3eub "The singer isn't conforming to a singular mode but instead is remaining open to both and being willing to adapt to whatever situation comes their way."
            m 2sub "In my interpretation, the singer is part of the mafia, but refuses to do things the old way, instead being open to change, going against the current."

            m 1etd "So, taking all that into consideration, what would 'Judge not the thorns in you' mean?"
            m 1eua "The song seems to tell a story about a place that refuses to change, sticking to the past, which could be the Siracusan mafia's customs."
            m 7eua "The singer refuses to pick a side in whatever conflict is going on, and instead chooses to keep their promise, refusing to fight against it, but also not running from it."

            m 4eub "Especially those that are based on past actions and behavior. It's a reminder that things aren't always black and white."
            m 4tud "So, even if the protagonist has made mistakes and done questionable things, there are still nuances to her character that should be considered."
